Ray Tracer\n

**THIS RAY TRACER UTILIZES A HIERARCHICAL BUILD SYSTEM USING CMAKE. YOU WILL NEED TO BE FAMILIAR 
WITH BUILDING A PROJECT USING CMAKE TO MAKE THIS WORK. I WILL INCLUDE AN EMPTY BUILD FILE FOR YOU TO
GENERATE DEPENDENCIES.**

**IN THIS RAY TRACER I DECIDED TO GO WITH THE COORDINATE SYSTEM THAT FLIPS THE Y AND Z AXES. IF Y INCREASES, THEN THE OBJECT GETS
PLACED FARTHER BACK INTO THE SCENE. IF Z INCREASES, THEN THE OBJECT MOVES UPWARDS IN THE SCENE.**

**.cpp FILES THAT BEGIN WITH `_` INDICATE A FILE NOT CREATED/MODIFIED BY ME**

**IMAGES GENERATED BY INPUT FILES IN Project/Test/Input_Files ARE FOUND IN Project/build/Test**

**TRIANGLE MESH TEXT FILES NEED TO BE FOUND IN Project/Test/Meshes**

**Source/Foundation INCLUDES BASE LEVEL FILES THAT ARE THE FOUNDATION OF MAKING AN IMAGE**

**Source/World_Creation INCLUDES FILES THAT CREATE THE WORLD AND THE SHAPES INSIDE OF THEM**

**Source/Parse CREATES A NICE WAY TO EASILY MAKE A SCENE USING A TEXT FILE**

**
TO CREATE A IMAGE YOU NEED TO GENERATE A INPUT FILE AND POSSIBLY A MESH FILES
I WILL INCLUDE AN EXAMPLE INPUT FILE TO HELP GET YOU STARTED
1. CREATE MATERIALS
2. CREATE OBJECTS AND MESHES 
3. IDENTIFY THE NUMBER OF THREADS YOU WANT TO COMPUTE ON
4. SPECIFY SAMPLES AND SCENE DEPTH
5. POSITION CAMERA 
6. SPECIFY IMAGE SIZE
7. SPECIFY OUTPUT FILE NAME
**

**IF YOU WANT TO TAKE ANY OF MY FILES AND USE THEM IN YOUR OWN PROJECT FEEL FREE IN DOING SO!**
